    "## Introduction:\n",
    "In this workshop we show you an example of a workflow in data science from initial data ingestion, cleaning, modeling, and ultimately clustering. In this example we scrape the news feed of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([NIST](www.nist.gov)). For those not in the know, NIST is comprised of multiple research centers which include: \n",
    "* Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST)\n",
    "* Engineering Laboratory (EL)\n",
